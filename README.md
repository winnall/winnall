👋 My name is Stephen Winnall, known as Steve (or @winnall on Github). I am a retired IT and Internet specialist living in Switzerland.

👀 I’m especially interested in home automation. I use [OpenHAB](https://www.openhab.org) to integrate various smart home technologies. I am focussing at the moment on establishing
professional-level infrastructure for my home, which entails dividing my organically grown home network into functional parts (at the top level: house and
family), so that the smart home will still function even if the family moves out.

🌱 I’m currently learning an awful lot about Ubuntu, which is my platform of choice for servers, and MacOS, which I use for desktops and laptops. And OpenHAB,
of course.

💞️ I’m open for an exchange of ideas on how to run a home network that has the scope of an SME's network. This includes: documentation for whoever takes over
the home network if the family moves out; and day-to-day operations of a network that - in a commercial environment - would have a full-time paid manager.
Sadly, the IT industry is currently more concerned with grabbing a piece of the IoT/smart home cake than providing any meaningful standards for interaction of
components.
