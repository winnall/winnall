I’m a retired IT and Internet specialist living in Switzerland, now building the 878 Network — a professional-grade digital home infrastructure.

The project reorganises my once-organic home network into functional domains (house ↔ family) so the smart home keeps running independently of who lives here.
It combines open tools — Ubuntu LTS, Docker Swarm, Ansible, LDAP, and OpenHAB 5 — with proper documentation in Obsidian to create a system that could be managed like an SME network.

I’m learning more every day about Ubuntu, macOS, and OpenHAB, and I’m keen to exchange ideas on:
	•	self-documenting home networks
	•	long-term maintainability of smart homes
	•	realistic standards for device interoperability

Because home automation should mean ownership and understanding, not dependence on cloud silos.
